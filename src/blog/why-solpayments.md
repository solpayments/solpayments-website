Growing up in Kenya, I see cryptocurrencies with a different lens than you do, if you grew up in the US for example. This opening sentence follows the format of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bernard_parah/status/1395406963870081024?s=20) that was making the rounds a while ago. I understand completely where the author comes from. I remember ten years or so ago when getting a PayPal account as a Kenyan was really hard (you could not withdraw your PayPal balance). Getting a Stripe account as a Kenyan is impossible right now unless you somehow magically get an American or European bank account. Does it have to be like this?

We think not. That is why we are building SolPayments. We strongly believe that anyone, anywhere in the world should be able to run their business and accept payments as easily as anyone else in the world. As Africans, this is particularly important to us. SolPayments represents our contribution to the noble goal of ensuring a level playing field for everyone everywhere.

It is still early days, and the following may change, but the tool that we are building supports:

- **E-commerce payments**. Our payment processing smart contract will be integrated in popular e-commerce platforms starting with WooCommerce. This ensures that only merchants have an option that is accessible and gives them full control over their money. It would be literally impossible to have their funds frozen or accounts banned for whatever reason.
- **Subscription payments**. We’ve built a simple way to accept and manage subscriptions so that as a merchant or builder you can monetize your web apps or other software easily and without requiring permission from anyone. Just integrate with our smart contract and boom! - you’re in business.
- **Fundraising**. Trying to raise money from large groups of people e.g. for charity or kickstarter-style crowdfunding should be accessible to anyone who needs to do so. Don’t you agree? With our smart contract, it would be possible for you or anyone in a straight-forward and secure way.

Additionally, our smart contract is available for anyone to reuse in their own product/project in any way that they please. We honestly can’t wait to see what else it can be used for.

This is just the beginning though. Hopefully the opening salvo in the efforts to ensure equitable access to payment processing services to those who need them the most.
